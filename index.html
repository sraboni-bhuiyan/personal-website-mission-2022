                    <p>Notebloc is a document scanner app that helps you scan paper and declutter: scan receipts, tickets, notes, drawings and other documents. You can create PDF documents or JPEG files. We eliminate any trace of shade in your photos: Imagine you could have the perfect light intensity to digitize your notes in any circumstance, time and place. That may seem impossible, but with the Notebloc app your digitized notes will look perfect, clean, without any imperfection due to light and shadow. In your digital image you will only get what there is written or drawn on a completely white background.

Tufts network storage, or shares, are folders and directories on secure Tufts servers that are accessible from any computer logged into the university network. The three most common shares are the P: (personal share for individual data storage), Q: (shared departmental data storage), and R: (research data storage) drives. These drives are backed up on a regular basis.</p>
